## What was OutTheDoor auto supposed to be:
The pitch for OutTheDoor auto was a Car sales website with an industry-leading user experience.

Portions of this article have been redacted due to my NDA.

## What I did there
While working at OTD Auto I created a fully functional, ready to ship rails-based website featuring:
- A system to create and manage listings on the site
- A robust search engine capable of handling millions of listings across the US
- Dynamic, inventory based monthly subscriptions via Stripe
- AI chatbot integrated with database providing relevant information helpful to the user

## My experience working there
This role started with me working as an unpaid intern in December of 2022. At that time the project was basically just a concept in 2 people's heads who had tried implementing it and gave up half-way through.

I started the project from scratch using Ruby on Rails. After getting the website to a functional proof of concept I signed a (in retrospect horrible) contract for me to get paid for my work. I would track my hours and get paid for them retrospectively after they had gotten investment.

I worked diligently from then on, sometimes waiting weeks to get feedback from my bosses. I watched as they brought in other unpaid interns who never contributed anything to the project.

I alone brought the site to a nearly feature-complete state, the only things left to do being as follows:
- integrate with DealerCenter to improve the experience of large dealerships using the site
- switch image storage from a temp SQL solution to AWS S3

Throughout the entire 2 years I have "worked" at OTD, I have been waiting on my bosses to establish a single FTP server that DealerCenter can send data to. This december I asked for AWS credentials so I can implement S3 image storage. It has been a month since that message and I have gotten no reply since.

I would've left last year but sunk-cost fallacy made me stay because they technically owe me tens of thousands and all thats left is "just a couple things" before investment and me getting paid.
