These are all QOL(quality of life), nice things to have that smooth the edges of a otherwise rough feature in the game.

I am continuing to maintain these to this day

Each project can be read about in detail on [my Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/user/F53/mods).
Independently made several quality of life mods for Minecraft Java Edition
- 42 thousand downloads as of November 2023.
- experience in working on adding functionality to a large, uncommented codebase
- early experience with collaborating with others on Github
