An online implementation of Cards Against Humanity with a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails Backend.
- Integrates websockets through Action Cable for a live updating game lobby

Eventually I want to re-do this in either:
- 100% Ruby on Rails (I feel like having to connect Rails and React caused a lot of pain)
- 100% Nuxt3 (I love Vue&Nuxt and would love to try writing a full stack app with live game play in it)
